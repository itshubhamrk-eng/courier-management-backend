/**

 * minimal prerequisite Shipment Movement needs underneath it (see V19's migration
 * comment) — enough to create a manifest, attach shipments to it, and assign a vehicle
 * and driver at dispatch time. No physical FK to booking/delivery branch, vehicle or
 * driver (a company user) — every one of them belongs to a different module, validated
 * in the service layer, the same cross-module treatment every id on {@code Shipment}
 * already gets.
