/**
 * The full lifecycle a shipment moves through. Transitions live here, in one place, rather
 * than as scattered {@code if} statements in a service — the same discipline the project's
 * own planning note for this module called for.
 *
 * <p><b>Shipment Booking itself only ever writes {@link #BOOKED} (on create) and
 * {@link #CANCELLED} (on cancel).</b> Shipment Movement (V19) writes every step from
 * {@link #MANIFEST_CREATED} through {@link #DELIVERED} — {@link #READY_FOR_MANIFEST} and
 * {@link #RETURNED} stay declared but unwritten by either module, the same "declared now,
 * used later" treatment the rest of this graph originally got: a pre-manifest "ready"
 * queue and a return flow are plausible future modules, not this one.
 *
 * <p>Renamed in V19 to match the Shipment Movement brief's own vocabulary exactly:
 * {@code MANIFESTED} -> {@link #MANIFEST_CREATED}, {@code RECEIVED} -> {@link #IN_SCAN},
 * {@code RETURN_INITIATED} folded into a direct edge to {@link #RETURNED}. A bare rename
 * was safe because nothing had ever written the old values (Shipment Booking's own
 * verification: "nothing yet transitions a shipment past BOOKED") — see V19's migration
 * comment.
 *
 * <p><b>V20, on direct request:</b> the standalone {@code OUT_SCAN} state (and the
 * separate "scan each shipment onto the manifest" action that wrote it) is gone —
 * {@link #MANIFEST_CREATED} now doubles as "loading sheet created" (see {@code ShipmentStatusBadge}'s
 * display label), and Dispatch's precondition moved from "at least one OUT_SCAN
 * shipment" to "at least one MANIFEST_CREATED shipment". The user's own words: "manifest
 * created as outscan created" — one milestone, not two. V20's migration folds any
 * `OUT_SCAN` rows (real ones exist from live verification of the two-step version) back
 * into {@code MANIFEST_CREATED}, the same fold-back-on-rename pattern V19 set.
 *
 * <p>{@link #MANIFEST_CREATED} -&gt; {@link #BOOKED} was originally the one backward edge in
 * this graph: removing a shipment from a still-{@code CREATED} manifest (see
 * {@code ManifestService.removeShipment}) reverts it to {@code BOOKED} so a future
 * manifest can pick it up, rather than leaving it stranded off every worklist.
 * {@link #MANIFEST_CREATED} -&gt; {@link #READY_FOR_MANIFEST} is the crossing-aware sibling
 * of that same edge: removing a shipment that has already advanced past its first crossing
 * hop reverts it to {@code READY_FOR_MANIFEST} instead, since {@code BOOKED} would wrongly
 * make it eligible for a fresh manifest starting from its original booking branch again.
 *
 * <p><b>Crossing (V37/V38):</b> {@link #DISPATCHED} -&gt; {@link #READY_FOR_MANIFEST} is a
 * second exit from {@code DISPATCHED}, alongside the existing {@link #IN_SCAN} one — taken
 * only when the branch performing the in-scan is an intermediate crossing hub, not the
 * shipment's own {@code deliveryBranchId} (see {@code ShipmentServiceImpl.scanOneIn}).
 * That is what finally gives {@link #READY_FOR_MANIFEST} a writer: a shipment received at
 * a hub is ready for its next leg's manifest, exactly what the status name already said
 * before anything wrote it.
