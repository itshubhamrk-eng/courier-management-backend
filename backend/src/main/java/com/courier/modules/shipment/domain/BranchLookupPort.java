/**
 * What Shipment Booking needs to know about branches, and nothing more — the two ends of
 * a booking.
 *
 * <p>Shipment owns the interface; {@code modules/company} supplies the adapter. The same
 * seam auth uses for companies ({@code CompanyDirectoryPort}), Finance uses for wallets
 * ({@code BranchDirectoryPort}), and Master uses for routes ({@code BranchLookupPort}) —
 * and, per Master's own documented reasoning, deliberately <b>not</b> a reuse of either of
 * those: importing Finance's port to talk about branches would make Shipment depend on
 * Finance for something that has nothing to do with money, which is a worse arrow than the
 * small duplication of a four-field record.
 *
 * <p>Booking needs this for the branch label shown on a list/detail response — branch
 * *existence and activity* is already established by {@code RouteService.findByBranches}
 * inside the Pricing Engine's own {@code RouteValidation} (a route only ever names two
 * real branches, validated when the route itself was created), so this port is a read for
 * display, not a second existence check.
 *
 * <p>The company is passed explicitly on every call, never taken from the ambient
 * {@code CompanyContext} — a caller that forgot to bind one gets nothing rather than
 * everything.
