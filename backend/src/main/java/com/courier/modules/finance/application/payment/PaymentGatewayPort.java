 * it, so a client cannot open checkout for ₹1 and claim a ₹10,000 recharge.
 * {@link #verifyPayment} then proves the confirmation the browser hands back really came
 * from the gateway, by re-deriving its signature from the shared secret.
 *
 * <p>Nothing in the wallet module knows the gateway's name, wire format or SDK. Swapping
